## Overview of the Analysis

* This data analysis uses historical lending activity from a lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Via Machine Learning - Logistic Regression method, it predicts future outcome of the home loan applications.
A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. 
A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
   * Model 1 Accuracy: 0.99
   * Healthy Loan (Low Risk) precision: 1.00
   * Healthy Loan (Low Risk)  recall: 1.00    
   * Unhealthy Loan (High Risk) precision: 0.87       
   * Unhealthy Loan (High Risk) precision: 0.89  

* Machine Learning Model 2:
   * Model 2 Accuracy: 1.00
   * Healthy Loan (Low Risk) precision: 1.00
   * Healthy Loan (Low Risk)  recall: 1.00    
   * Unhealthy Loan (High Risk) precision: 0.87       
   * Unhealthy Loan (High Risk) precision: 1.00  

## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use.
* Both models have good accuracy and Healthy Loan scores.
* However, model 2 witnesses the higer Unhealthy Loan recall percentage indicating that Model 2 is better to use.
