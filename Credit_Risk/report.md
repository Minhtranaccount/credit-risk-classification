## Overview of the Analysis

* This data analysis uses historical lending activity from a lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Via Machine Learning - Logistic Regression method, it predict future outcome of the home loan applications.
A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. 
A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Both models have good accuracy  score and Healthy Loan scores.
* However, model 2 witnesses the higer Unhealthy Loan recall percentage indicating that Model 2 is better to use.
